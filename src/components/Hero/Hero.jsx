            <p className= {styles.paragraph}>a Computer Science student at the University of New Orleans, 
                graduating in December 2024. I specialize in game development and have hands-on experience 
                with languages like Java, C#, C++, and Python, along with frameworks like React Native and Unity. 
                My projects range from mobile applications to game prototypes, demonstrating my ability to create efficient, 
                scalable solutions. Iâ€™m now looking to launch my career in the tech industry, where I can apply my 
                skills in software development and problem-solving to drive impactful results.</p>
